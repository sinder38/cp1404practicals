# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following. Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Hit or miss

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Well I just read the task and estimated on previous experiences.
I did not change my methods of estimation

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

To estimate more accurately I need to read the task full before starting.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

No one reviewed me

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Nothing

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 7 review](https://github.com/chlstndy/cp1404/pull/2)

### Explanation

This repository was very chaotic, I think I found most of the problems there.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 6 review](https://github.com/jihun9812/cp1404practicals/pull/2)

### Explanation

I think I provided good feedback on about the formating and was relatively polite.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would make it much harder and focused on algorithms and no limitations on syntax that provides no advantage but makes
code more beautiful (e.g. lambda, assert, static typing).

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Almost everything. I did make some minor "mistakes" that don't affect program functional
